# To-the-moon-and-hack
An AR based submission to a Major League Hackathon

This was a space themed hack.
We simulated space using Augmented Reality.
Primarily used lens studio.
## What it does
The user first gets to chose a favorite astronaut's face, wears the astronaut helmet, and sees his rocket shoot up from earth to moon. He then gets an augmented experience of solar system and constellations and gets to meet and dance with some aliens too!

## How we built it
Lenses, faces, aliens and astronauts were built using Lens Studio and unity+vuforia was used for AR/VR constellations

## Challenges we ran into
Since we were working on different components that too on different platforms, integrating all the different components together was a problem as we were having trouble importing unity models to lens studio.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were newbies to AR/VR and all of our work revolves around that. So gathering resources, getting to learn about "Lens studio" had to be completed in 48 hours. And we are proud of finishing our project and integrating all in the video. We experimented with a new platform and completed a project and that is in itself a great achievement!

## Update
This project won second overall
